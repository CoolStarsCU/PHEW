# PHEW 

Python tools to calculate the equivalent width, line depth, and full width at half maximum of a line for a given spectrum using [PySpecKit](http://pyspeckit.bitbucket.org/html/sphinx/index.html). By: Munazza Alam

## Information

Created on July 8, 2015 from a variety of routines I have written in the past. 

## Files

1. EqW.py - calculates equivalent width (EqW) and estimates uncertainty via Monte Carlo iterations
2. FWHM.py - calculates full width at half maximum (FWHM) and estimates uncertainty via Monte Carlo iterations 
3. linedepth.py - calculates line depth and estimates uncertainty via Monte Carlo iterations
