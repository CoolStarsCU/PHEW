## Ways to use PHEW ##

This folder provides two example methods to use PHEW when measuring the equivalent width of spectra.

## Sample Code ##

* __EW_AUTOMATED_LITE__
  * This is a bare-bones code highlighting a way to use PHEW when dealing with many spectra. Being so bare-bones, this code gives a lot of room for the user to     embellish upon and add features they need.

* __EW_WRAPPER_INTERACTIVE__
  * This is a highly interactive wrapper that contains much of the needed functionality to efficiently and methodically measure equivalent widths for a large quantitiy of spectra. Further documentation can be found in "EW_README.md"

* __readspec__
  * This code is a sample spectra reader that needs to be downloaded to execute the above codes. Depending on the kind of spectrum being fit, a number of these kinds of codes can be used, this is simply the one which works for our spectra.

## SAMPLE DATA ##

* __TEST_PHEW_LITE__ 
  * This folder contains simple sample spectra that work well to show the capabilities of *__EW_AUTOMATED_LITE__*

* __TEST_PHEW_SAMP__ 
  * This folder contains a more diverse set of sample spectra that show off the capabilities of *__EW_AUTOMATED_INTERACTIVE__*
