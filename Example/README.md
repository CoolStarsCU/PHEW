## Ways to use PHEW ##

This folder provides two example methods to use PHEW when measuring the equivalent width of spectra.

## Sample Code ##

  ## EW_AUTOMATED_LITE ##

  This is a bare-bones code highlighting a way to use PHEW when dealing with many spectra. Being so bare-bones, this code gives a lot of room for the user to     embellish upon and add features they need.

  ## EW_AUTOMATED_INTERACTIVE ##

  This is a highly interactive wrapper that contains much of the needed functionality to efficiently and methodically measure equivalent widths for a large quantitiy of spectra. Further documentation can be found in "EW_README.md"
