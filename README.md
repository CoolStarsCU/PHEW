PHEW (PytHon Equivalent Widths): 

Python tools to calculate the equivalent width, line depth, and full width at half maximum of a line for a given spectrum using PySpecKit. By: Munazza Alam

Information:
Created on July 8, 2015 from a variety of spectral line analysis routines I have written in the past. All uncertainties on measurements are estimated via Monte Carlo iterations. 

Files:
1. EqW.py - calculates equivalent width (EqW) and estimates uncertainty via Monte Carlo iterations
2. FWHM.py - calculates full width at half maximum (FWHM) and estimates uncertainty via Monte Carlo iterations 
3. linedepth.py - calculates line depth and estimates uncertainty via Monte Carlo iterations
